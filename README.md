# monolog
Chainable CLI Prompting Library for Go

[godoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/rucuriousyet/monolog)

This is just a little library I wrote for use with Stackmesh CLI tooling. It only uses Golang stdlib packages and is somewhat extensible. If you would like to use this in your own project, take a look at the following:

+ [godoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/rucuriousyet/monolog)

+ [godoc for prototype prompts](https://godoc.org/github.com/rucuriousyet/monolog/prototypes)


This library can easily be installed using the Go tool:
`go get -v -u github.com/rucuriousyet/monolog`

Feel free to ask questions or report bugs using Github issues, I hope you enjoy!
